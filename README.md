Here’s a brief description of a Twitch bot program with a UI interface for GitHub:

This project features a Twitch bot integrated with a graphical user interface (UI) to make managing and configuring the bot easier for Twitch streamers. The program is built using Python and the TwitchIO library to interact with the Twitch API. The UI is developed using Tkinter, allowing users to adjust the bot’s settings, send messages to chat, manage moderation, and perform other tasks directly through the interface.
